# Changes outside the controlled path

From Genesis Mesh 1.3.0 the Network Authority (NA) records changes that did
not go through `governedAction`, and judges each one once, as of the time it
happened:

- an **observation**: a change an observer saw at its source (a cloud
  activity log entry, or a reconciliation finding), signed by an observer key;
- a **break-glass record**: a change a controller made while the NA could not
  be reached, with its caller's justification, signed by the executor key.

The NA must run with `EVIDENCE_STORE=on` and `EVIDENCE_OUT_OF_BAND=on`. Until
then the routes answer `404 out_of_band_disabled`, and records in the record
outbox wait. The operator's side is described in *Changes Outside the
Controlled Path* in the NA runbooks.

## Record outbox

Observations and break-glass records are kept in a record outbox until the NA
admits them, as `FileOutbox` keeps execution records. Give it a directory of
its own:

```ts
import { FileRecordOutbox, GenesisMeshClient } from 'genesis-mesh-sdk';

const gm = new GenesisMeshClient({
  baseUrl, signingKeyBase64, keyId,
  recordOutbox: new FileRecordOutbox('/var/lib/app/gm-records'),
});
await gm.evidenceStore.flushRecords(); // at startup and on a timer
```

`enqueueRecord` keeps a record and submits it; a transient failure leaves it
pending, and a refusal no retry can overcome (`RECORD_PERMANENT_REFUSALS`)
keeps it as a dead letter. `flushRecords` submits pending records in order,
observations up to 100 at a time. A record the NA admits outside its time
bounds is kept by the NA as a quarantine entry and is listed in the run's
`quarantined`.

## Observers

Register the observer's key with `role: 'observer'`, scoped to the resources
it watches (privileged operator key):

```ts
await gm.evidenceStore.registerExecutorKey({
  key_id: 'activity-log-observer', public_key, executor_sovereign_id: 'cloud-observer',
  role: 'observer', resource_prefix: 'kv:prod/',
});
```

Then sign each change with an `ObservationRecorder`:

```ts
import { ObservationRecorder, seedSigner } from 'genesis-mesh-sdk';

const observer = new ObservationRecorder({
  observerSovereignId: 'cloud-observer',
  signer: seedSigner(observerSeed, 'activity-log-observer'),
});
const observation = await observer.record({
  resource_id: 'kv:prod/api-key', action: 'rotate', capability: 'secret.rotate',
  changed_at: event.time, source: 'cloud-activity-log', source_event_id: event.id,
  actor: event.principalHash, version_id: event.version,
  metadata: { lifetime_days: 30 },
});
await gm.evidenceStore.enqueueRecord(observation);
```

`actor` is recorded as the source reported it and is not authenticated: use
a pseudonymous identifier, never a credential. `metadata` passes the secret
guard: names, versions and times, never values. Name the version
(`version_id`) when the source reports one: the NA matches the observation to
execution evidence for the same resource, action and capability that reports
the same `execution_parameters.version_id`, and the change is then governed
by that evidence's decision, unless the observer's own facts are denied by
the policies active then. A second observer's report of the same version is
the same change.

A reconciliation finding knows only that a resource changed between two
scans. `observationFromFinding` turns one into an observation input with
that window; the NA judges it at both ends:

```ts
const findings = reconcileResources(inventory, await gm.evidenceStore.resourceStates());
for (const finding of findings) {
  const input = observationFromFinding(finding, { capability: 'secret.rotate', previousScanAt, scannedAt });
  if (input) await gm.evidenceStore.enqueueRecord(await observer.record(input));
}
```

## Break-glass

With `breakGlass`, `governedAction` runs the action even when the evaluation
fails transiently (network error, timeout, `5xx`, `429`), and keeps a signed
break-glass record in the record outbox. The action then gets a null
decision, and the result is a `BreakGlassResult`:

```ts
const result = await governedAction(gm, recorder, {
  ...params, breakGlass: { justification: 'incident 42: rotate the leaked key now' },
}, async decision => rotate(decision));
if ('brokeGlass' in result) {
  console.warn(`ran without a decision (${result.failure}); recorded as ${result.record.break_glass_id}`);
}
```

A DENY never breaks the glass, nor does a decision that fails verification,
the NA throttling failed operator signatures (`429 admin_auth_throttled`),
an evaluation it could not store (`503 evidence_store_unavailable`), or any
other error. `breakGlass` needs a record outbox, `resource_id` and an
attestation-based evaluation (`attestation_id`: an agreement-based one cannot
be judged after the fact), and checks the justification and the context
against the secret guard before anything is evaluated or run. Every use shows in the resource's changes, with
its justification; a policy can forbid it for a capability (a `denylist.v1`
gate on `parent_kind` with the value `break_glass`).

## Judgements and the state of a resource

The NA judges each record at admission unless that is turned off; the
operator judges the rest with `judgeObservation` and `judgeBreakGlass`.
`resourceChanges` lists every change to a resource, with how it was governed
(`prior_decision` or `after_the_fact`) and its state (`recorded`, `matched`,
`judged_allowed`, `judged_denied`, `indeterminate`, `observed`,
`quarantined`). A judgement has no `authorized` field: it is never an
approval, and `verifyEvidenceEvents` refuses execution evidence that cites
one (`evidence_cites_judgement`).

## Verifying exports

`verifyEvidenceEvents` verifies the new entry kinds offline:

- observations under observer keys and break-glass records under executor
  keys (`listExecutorKeys` returns each key's `role`); an execution record
  signed by an observer key does not verify;
- judgements, quarantine and registry entries under the NA keys;
- each resource's observation positions (`observation_chain_break`), one
  judgement per record (`duplicate_judgement`) that matches it
  (`judgement_subject_mismatch`, `judgement_subject_missing`), and execution
  evidence matched once (`match_reused`).

The result counts them in `observations`, `break_glass`, `judgements` and
`quarantined`.
